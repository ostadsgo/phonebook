for creating a simple menu we can do something like this:

``` python
menu = """
1) Add contact
2) Update contact
3) Delete contact
4) Exit
"""

```

The we can create a inf loop to show this menu an wait for a response from user

``` python
# -- code snippet -- 
while True:
    print(menu)
    response = input("Choose from menu: ")
```

the first thing we want is way to terminate the program.
in our menu if user responsed `4` program will finished execuation.

```python
# -- code snippet ---
while True:
    print(menu)
    response = input("Choose from menu: ")
    if response == '4':
        break
```

after this we need to handle other case like if user respones was `1` we need to get a `name` and a `phone_number` and etc.


```python
# -- code snippet ---
contacts = []
while True:
    print(menu)
    response = input("Choose from menu: ")
    # break while loop
    if response == '4':
        break
    elif response == '1':
        name = input("Name: ")
        phone = input("Phone: ")
        contact = (name, phone)
        contacts.append(contact)
    # update a contact
    elif response == '2':
        pass
    # delete a contact
    elif response == '3':
        pass
    # other response
    else: 
        print("Wrong choice.")
```
In the code above we make `contacts` list. All contacts that user make will add to this list. if the response weren't that case were handle in `else` clause.

### Update a contact
First we are going to get a name if name exist in the `contacts` list we are going response user to add new name and new phone and we will change the contacts list to have the new contact.
```python
# -- code snippet -- 
while True:
    # -- code snippet -- 
    elif response == '2':
        name = input("Name to search: ")
        for contact in contacts:
            if contact[0] == name:
                new_name = input("New name: ")
                new_phone = input("New phone: ")
                cnt = (new_name, new_phone)
                contacts

            
```
