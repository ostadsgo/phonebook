# Phonebook
### Learn python programming by making a phonebook application
in this project I will go over from simple phonebook app
to very sophistcated one.

I start with simple version which use python `list` to store data
then I use python `pickle` module to store data permently.

The next step is using sqlite to store data

In all these step I will talk about why we need this transaction, why we decide to use this technique or not.
